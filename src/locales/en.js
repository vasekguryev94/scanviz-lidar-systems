      scanVizThisContent: 'In a few minutes, our systems can be mounted on a drone, on an airplane, on a car, on a railway transport, on a ship, or in a backpack. The developed platform allows you to assemble an inexpensive entry-level system with inexpensive LIDAR (for example, Velodyne VLP16), GNSS modules (for example, Piksi Multi), IMU, 360 CAMERAS so that you can start working today, and later easily change individual devices to higher devices class up to the top and expensive high-precision solutions (Novatel, Z + F Profiler, Applanix). The developed software [for management and data collection] has a [common for all devices] web interface and is accessible from any devices. The result of our systems is a ready-made point cloud immediately in the LAS file! The raw data is also available to you and your post-processing software. We allow to improve the system to the increasing requirements and different equipment without the need to change the usual mode of operation, no need to switch to different software solutions from different manufacturers.',

In just a few minutes ScanViz system can be installed on any type of vehicle or even backpack of an operator. Designed platform allows easily setting up entry level system (LIDAR Velodyne VLP16, GNSS modules Piksi Multi, IMU, 360Â° view cameras) to get started work already today with possibility to upgrade each element up to the top rated high-precision solutions (Novatel, Z+F Profiler, Riegl, Applanix). Modular upgrade options also: Dual LiDAR Sensors, DSLR, GeniCam, GigEVision, thermal, multispectral, hyperspectral, sonar, and custom sensors. Just change LiDAR and IMU without necessity to buy new system for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The developed software has a simple and intuitive web-interface with access from any device (PC, smartphone, tablet). The result of the ScanViz system is a ready-made 3D color point clouds in the LAS file! Raw data is also available for post-processing by third-party software. Improve your scanning system as the needs increase in the usual mode of operation. Our mission is to make laser scanning technology understandable and affordable tool for widespread use.'
